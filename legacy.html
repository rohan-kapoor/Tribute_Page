    Gandhi influenced important leaders and political movements. Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United
    States, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the
    development of their own theories about nonviolence. King said "Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the
    tactics." King sometimes referred to Gandhi as "the little brown saint." Anti-apartheid activist and former
    President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was inspired by Gandhi. Others include Steve Biko, Václav Havel, and Aung
    San Suu Kyi. <br><br>

    In his early years, the former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was a follower of the nonviolent resistance
    philosophy of Gandhi. Bhana and Vahed commented on these events as "Gandhi inspired succeeding generations of South
    African activists seeking to end White rule. This legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela...in a sense, Mandela
    completed what Gandhi started." <br><br>

    Gandhi's life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their
    lives to spreading Gandhi's ideas. In Europe, Romain Rolland was the first to discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book
    Mahatma Gandhi, and Brazilian anarchist and feminist Maria Lacerda de Moura wrote about Gandhi in her work on
    pacifism. In 1931, physicist Albert Einstein exchanged letters with Gandhi, and called him "a role model for the
    generations to come" in a letter writing about him. Einstein said of Gandhi: <br><br>

    Mahatma Gandhi's life achievement stands unique in political history. He has invented a completely new and humane
    means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral
    influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more
    lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only be the
    work of such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and
    educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a
    role model for the generations to come. Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the
    earth in flesh and blood. <br><br>

    Farah Omar, a political activist from Somaliland visited India in 1930, where he met Gandhi and was influenced by
    Gandhi's non-violent philosophy which he adopted in his campaign in British Somaliland. <br><br>

    Lanza del Vasto went to India in 1936 intending to live with Gandhi; he later returned to Europe to spread Gandhi's
    philosophy and founded the Community of the Ark in 1948 (modelled after Gandhi's ashrams). Madeleine Slade (known as
    "Mirabehn") was the daughter of a British admiral who spent much of her adult life in India as a devotee of Gandhi.
    <br><br>

    In addition, the British musician John Lennon referred to Gandhi when discussing his views on nonviolence. In 2007,
    former US Vice-President and environmentalist Al Gore drew upon Gandhi's idea of satyagraha in a speech on climate
    change.

    US President Barack Obama said in a 2010 address to the Parliament of India that:

    I am mindful that I might not be standing before you today, as President of the United States, had it not been for
    Gandhi and the message he shared with America and the world. <br><br>

    Obama said in September 2009 that his biggest inspiration came from Gandhi. His reply was in response to the
    question "Who was the one person, dead or live, that you would choose to dine with?". He continued that "He's
    somebody I find a lot of inspiration in. He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence. He ended up doing so
    much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics." <br><br>

    Time magazine named The 14th Dalai Lama, Lech Wałęsa, Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, Aung San Suu Kyi,
    Benigno Aquino Jr., Desmond Tutu, and Nelson Mandela as Children of Gandhi and his spiritual heirs to nonviolence.
    The Mahatma Gandhi District in Houston, Texas, United States, an ethnic Indian enclave, is officially named after
    Gandhi. <br><br>

    Gandhi's ideas had a significant influence on 20th-century philosophy. It began with his engagement with Romain
    Rolland and Martin Buber. Jean-Luc Nancy said that the French philosopher Maurice Blanchot engaged critically with
    Gandhi from the point of view of "European spirituality". Since then philosophers including Hannah Arendt, Etienne
    Balibar and Slavoj Žižek found that Gandhi was a necessary reference to discuss morality in politics. Recently in
    the light of climate change Gandhi's views on technology are gaining importance in the fields of environmental
    philosophy and philosophy of technology.<br><br>

    Time magazine named Gandhi the Man of the Year in 1930. In the same magazine's 1999 list of The Most Important
    People of the Century, Gandhi was second only to Albert Einstein, who had called Gandhi "the greatest man of our
    age". The University of Nagpur awarded him an LL.D. in 1937. The Government of India awarded the annual Gandhi Peace
    Prize to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens. Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa's
    struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, was a prominent non-Indian recipient. In 2011, Gandhi
    topped the TIME's list of top 25 political icons of all time. <br><br>

    Gandhi did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize, although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including
    the first-ever nomination by the American Friends Service Committee, though he made the short list only twice, in
    1937 and 1947. Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to
    deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award.Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before
    nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that "there was no suitable
    living candidate" and later research shows that the possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was
    discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi. <br><br>

    Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, "The greatest omission in our 106-year history
    is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace
    prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question". When the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the
    Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was "in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi".
    In the summer of 1995, the North American Vegetarian Society inducted him posthumously into the Vegetarian Hall of
    Fame. <br><br>

    A five-hour nine-minute long biographical documentary film, Mahatma: Life of Gandhi, 1869-1948, made by Vithalbhai
    Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black and white archival footage and photographs, captures the
    history of those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy
    Award for Best Picture. It was based on the biography by Louis Fischer.The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma
    documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised
    political leader. Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's
    Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing
    memory of Gandhi's values as a metaphor for the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes
    Vinay Lal. <br><br>

    In 1967, Gandhi was set to be featured on the album cover of one of the best selling albums of The Beatles, Sgt.
    Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, however this idea was later cancelled due to respect for Gandhi. <br><br>

    The 1979 opera Satyagraha by American composer Philip Glass is loosely based on Gandhi's life. The opera's libretto,
    taken from the Bhagavad Gita, is sung in the original Sanskrit. <br><br>

    The 1995 Marathi play Gandhi Virudh Gandhi explored the relationship between Gandhi and his son Harilal. The 2007
    film, Gandhi, My Father was inspired on the same theme. The 1989 Marathi play Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy and the 1997
    Hindi play Gandhi Ambedkar criticised Gandhi and his principles. <br><br>

    Several biographers have undertaken the task of describing Gandhi's life. Among them are D. G. Tendulkar with his
    Mahatma. Life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in eight volumes, Chaman Nahal's Gandhi Quartet, and Pyarelal and
    Sushila Nayyar with their Mahatma Gandhi in 10 volumes. The 2010 biography, Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His
    Struggle With India by Joseph Lelyveld contained controversial material speculating about Gandhi's sexual life.
    Lelyveld, however, stated that the press coverage "grossly distort[s]" the overall message of the book. The 2014
    film Welcome Back Gandhi takes a fictionalised look at how Gandhi might react to modern day India. The 2019 play
    Bharat Bhagya Vidhata, inspired by Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai and produced by Sangeet Natak Akademi and Shrimad
    Rajchandra Mission Dharampur takes a look at how Gandhi cultivated the values of truth and non-violence. <br><br>

    "Mahatma Gandhi" is used by Cole Porter in his lyrics for the song You're the Top which is included in the 1934
    musical Anything Goes. In the song, Porter rhymes "Mahatma Gandhi' with "Napoleon Brandy." <br><br>
