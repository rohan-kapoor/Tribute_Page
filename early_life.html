    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family in Porbandar (also
    known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of
    Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822-1885), served
    as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state. His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was
    then Junagadh State. <br><br>

    Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand
    proved a capable chief minister. During his tenure, he married four times. His first two wives died young, after
    each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, he sought his third wife's
    permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844-1891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a
    Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas (c.
    1860-1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862-1960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866-1913). <br>
    <br>

    On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the
    Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as
    mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears." The Indian
    classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood.
    In his autobiography, he states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: "It haunted me and I
    must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and
    love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters. <br><br>

    The family's religious background was eclectic. Gandhi's father Karamchand was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was
    from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family. Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya. His mother
    came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the
    Bhagavata Purana, and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of
    the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible. Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who "would
    not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows and keep them without
    flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her. <br><br>

    In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to
    its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional
    political agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of security. In 1876, Karamchand became
    diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in
    Rajkot. <br><br>

    At age 9, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There, he studied the rudiments of arithmetic,
    history, the Gujarati language and geography.[60] At the age of 11, he joined the High School in Rajkot, Alfred High
    School. He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in
    games; his only companions were books and school lessons. <br><br>

    In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia (her first name was
    usually shortened to "Kasturba", and affectionately to "Ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the
    region at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his
    studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their
    marriage, he once said, "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating
    sweets and playing with relatives." As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at
    her parents' house, and away from her husband. <br><br>

    Gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and
    family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife
    Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his
    wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi
    wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from
    meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan
    and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing. <br><br>


    Gandhi in London as a law student
    On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. Upon arrival, he stayed with the
    local Modh Bania community whose elders warned him that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat
    and drink in Western ways. Despite Gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings, he was
    excommunicated from his caste. Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London, with his
    brother seeing him off. Gandhi attended University College, London, where he took classes in English literature with
    Henry Morley in 1888-1889. <br><br>

    He also enrolled at Inner Temple with the intention of becoming a barrister. His childhood shyness and
    self-withdrawal had continued through his teens. He retained these traits when he arrived in London, but joined a
    public speaking practice group and overcame his shyness sufficiently to practise law. <br><br>

    He demonstrated a keen interest in the welfare of London's impoverished dockland communities. In 1889, a bitter
    trade dispute broke out in London, with dockers striking for better pay and conditions, and seamen, shipbuilders,
    factory girls and other joining the strike in solidarity. The strikers were successful, in part due to the mediation
    of Cardinal Manning, leading Gandhi and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him
    for his work. <br><br>

    <b style="font-size:larger"> Vegetarianism and committee work

    </b><br><br>
    <img src="/Assets/Gandhi_3.jpg" alt="Mahatma Gandhi" class="sub_images_right">
    Gandhi's time in London was influenced by the vow he had made to his mother. He tried to adopt "English" customs,
    including taking dancing lessons. However, he did not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady
    and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by Henry Salt's
    writing, he joined the London Vegetarian Society, and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its
    president and benefactor Arnold Hills. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater
    chapter. Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in 1875 to
    further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature. They encouraged
    Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original. <br><br>

    Gandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued
    LVS membership of fellow committee member Thomas Allinson. Their disagreement is the first known example of Gandhi
    challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation. <br><br>

    Allinson had been promoting newly available birth control methods, but Hills disapproved of these, believing they
    undermined public morality. He believed vegetarianism to be a moral movement and that Allinson should therefore no
    longer remain a member of the LVS. Gandhi shared Hills' views on the dangers of birth control, but defended
    Allinson's right to differ. It would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and
    unlike Gandhi, highly eloquent. He bankrolled the LVS and was a captain of industry with his Thames Ironworks
    company employing more than 6,000 people in the East End of London. He was also a highly accomplished sportsman who
    later founded the football club West Ham United. In his 1927 An Autobiography, Vol. I, Gandhi wrote: <br><br>

    The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought it was quite
    improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the
    objects of the society <br><br>

    A motion to remove Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee. Gandhi's shyness was an
    obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting. He wrote his views down on paper but shyness prevented
    him from reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them out for
    him. Although some other members of the committee agreed with Gandhi, the vote was lost and Allinson excluded. There
    were no hard feelings, with Hills proposing the toast at the LVS farewell dinner in honour of Gandhi's return to
    India. <br><br>
