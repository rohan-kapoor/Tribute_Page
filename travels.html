    Between 1878 and 1932, Tagore set foot in more than thirty countries on five continents. In 1912, he took a sheaf of
    his translated works to England, where they gained attention from missionary and Gandhi protégé Charles F. Andrews,
    Irish poet William Butler Yeats, Ezra Pound, Robert Bridges, Ernest Rhys, Thomas Sturge Moore, and others. Yeats
    wrote the preface to the English translation of Gitanjali; Andrews joined Tagore at Santiniketan. In November 1912
    Tagore began touring the United States and the United Kingdom, staying in Butterton, Staffordshire with Andrews's
    clergymen friends. From May 1916 until April 1917, he lectured in Japan and the United States. He denounced
    nationalism. His essay "Nationalism in India" was scorned and praised; it was admired by Romain Rolland and other
    pacifists. <br><br>
    Shortly after returning home the 63-year-old Tagore accepted an invitation from the Peruvian government. He
    travelled to Mexico. Each government pledged US$100,000 to his school to commemorate the visits. A week after his 6
    November 1924 arrival in Buenos Aires, an ill Tagore shifted to the Villa Miralrío at the behest of Victoria Ocampo.
    He left for home in January 1925. In May 1926 Tagore reached Naples; the next day he met Mussolini in Rome. Their
    warm rapport ended when Tagore pronounced upon Il Duce's fascist finesse. He had earlier enthused: "[w]without any
    doubt he is a great personality. There is such a massive vigor in that head that it reminds one of Michael Angelo's
    chisel." A "fire-bath" of fascism was to have educed "the immortal soul of Italy ... clothed in quenchless light".

    On 1 November 1926 Tagore arrived at Hungary and spent some time on the shore of Lake Balaton in the city of
    Balatonfüred, recovering from heart problems at a sanitarium. He planted a tree, and a bust statue was placed there
    in 1956 (a gift from the Indian government, the work of Rasithan Kashar, replaced by a newly gifted statue in 2005)
    and the lakeside promenade still bears his name since 1957. <br><br>
    On 14 July 1927 Tagore and two companions began a four-month tour of Southeast Asia. They visited Bali, Java, Kuala
    Lumpur, Malacca, Penang, Siam, and Singapore. The resultant travelogues compose Jatri (1929). In early 1930 he left
    Bengal for a nearly year-long tour of Europe and the United States. Upon returning to Britain—and as his paintings
    were exhibited in Paris and London—he lodged at a Birmingham Quaker settlement. He wrote his Oxford Hibbert
    Lectures[c] and spoke at the annual London Quaker meet. There, addressing relations between the British and the
    Indians - a topic he would tackle repeatedly over the next two years - Tagore spoke of a "dark chasm of aloofness".
    He visited Aga Khan III, stayed at Dartington Hall, toured Denmark, Switzerland, and Germany from June to
    mid-September 1930, then went on into the Soviet Union. In April 1932 Tagore, intrigued by the Persian mystic Hafez,
    was hosted by Reza Shah Pahlavi. In his other travels, Tagore interacted with Henri Bergson, Albert Einstein, Robert
    Frost, Thomas Mann, George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, and Romain Rolland. Visits to Persia and Iraq (in 1932) and Sri
    Lanka (in 1933) composed Tagore's final foreign tour, and his dislike of communalism and nationalism only deepened.
    Vice-president of India M. Hamid Ansari has said that Rabindranath Tagore heralded the cultural rapprochement
    between communities, societies and nations much before it became the liberal norm of conduct. Tagore was a man ahead
    of his time. He wrote in 1932, while on a visit to Iran, that "each country of Asia will solve its own historical
    problems according to its strength, nature and needs, but the lamp they will each carry on their path to progress
    will converge to illuminate the common ray of knowledge.
