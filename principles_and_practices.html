    <img src="/Assets/Principles_1.jpg" alt="Mahatma Gandhi" class="sub_images_right">
    Gandhi grew up in a Hindu and Jain religious atmosphere in his native Gujarat, which were his primary influences,
    but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, Advaita Vedanta,
    Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, and thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau.At age 57 he declared himself to be
    Advaitist Hindu in his religious persuasion, but added that he supported Dvaitist viewpoints and religious
    pluralism. <br><br>

    Gandhi was influenced by his devout Vaishnava Hindu mother, the regional Hindu temples and saint tradition which
    co-existed with Jain tradition in Gujarat.Historian R.B. Cribb states that Gandhi's thought evolved over time, with
    his early ideas becoming the core or scaffolding for his mature philosophy. He committed himself early to
    truthfulness, temperance, chastity, and vegetarianism. <br><br>

    Gandhi's London lifestyle incorporated the values he had grown up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his
    outlook was parochial and he could not make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and
    morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed
    the central concepts of his mature philosophy. <br><br>

    According to Bhikhu Parekh, three books that influenced Gandhi most in South Africa were William Salter's Ethical
    Religion (1889); Henry David Thoreau's On the Duty of Civil Disobedience (1849); and Leo Tolstoy's The Kingdom of
    God Is Within You (1894). The art critic and critic of political economy John Ruskin inspired his decision to live
    an austere life on a commune, at first on the Phoenix Farm in Natal and then on the Tolstoy Farm just outside
    Johannesburg, South Africa.The most profound influence on Gandhi were those from Hinduism, Christianity and Jainism,
    states Parekh, with his thoughts "in harmony with the classical Indian traditions, specially the Advaita or monistic
    tradition". <br><br>

    According to Indira Carr and others, Gandhi was influenced by Vaishnavism, Jainism and Advaita Vedanta. Balkrishna
    Gokhale states that Gandhi was influenced by Hinduism and Jainism, and his studies of Sermon on the Mount of
    Christianity, Ruskin and Tolstoy. <br><br>

    Additional theories of possible influences on Gandhi have been proposed. For example, in 1935, N. A. Toothi stated
    that Gandhi was influenced by the reforms and teachings of the Swaminarayan tradition of Hinduism. According to
    Raymond Williams, Toothi may have overlooked the influence of the Jain community, and adds close parallels do exist
    in programs of social reform in the Swaminarayan tradition and those of Gandhi, based on "nonviolence,
    truth-telling, cleanliness, temperance and upliftment of the masses." Historian Howard states the culture of Gujarat
    influenced Gandhi and his methods. <br><br>

    <b style="font-size:larger">Wars
    </b><br><br>

    Gandhi participated in forming the Indian Ambulance Corps in the South African war against the Boers, on the British
    side in 1899. Both the Dutch settlers called Boers and the imperial British at that time discriminated against the
    coloured races they considered as inferior, and Gandhi later wrote about his conflicted beliefs during the Boer war.
    He stated that "when the war was declared, my personal sympathies were all with the Boers, but my loyalty to the
    British rule drove me to participation with the British in that war. I felt that, if I demanded rights as a British
    citizen, it was also my duty, as such to participate in the defence of the British Empire, so I collected together
    as many comrades as possible, and with very great difficulty got their services accepted as an ambulance corps."
    <br><br>

    During World War I (1914-1918), nearing the age of 50, Gandhi supported the British and its allied forces by
    recruiting Indians to join the British army, expanding the Indian contingent from about 100,000 to over 1.1
    million.He encouraged Indian people to fight on one side of the war in Europe and Africa at the cost of their
    lives.Pacifists criticised and questioned Gandhi, who defended these practices by stating, according to Sankar
    Ghose, "it would be madness for me to sever my connection with the society to which I belong".According to Keith
    Robbins, the recruitment effort was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj
    (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I.After the war, the British government offered minor
    reforms instead, which disappointed Gandhi.He launched his satyagraha movement in 1919. In parallel, Gandhi's
    fellowmen became sceptical of his pacifist ideas and were inspired by the ideas of nationalism and anti-imperialism.
    <br><br>

    In a 1920 essay, after the World War I, Gandhi wrote, "where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence,
    I would advise violence." Rahul Sagar interprets Gandhi's efforts to recruit for the British military during the
    War, as Gandhi's belief that, at that time, it would demonstrate that Indians were willing to fight. Further, it
    would also show the British that his fellow Indians were "their subjects by choice rather than out of cowardice." In
    1922, Gandhi wrote that abstinence from violence is effective and true forgiveness only when one has the power to
    punish, not when one decides not to do anything because one is helpless. <br><br>

    After World War II engulfed Britain, Gandhi actively campaigned to oppose any help to the British war effort and any
    Indian participation in the war by launching Quit India Movement. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi believed that
    his campaign would strike a blow to imperialism. The British government responded with mass arrests including that
    of Gandhi and Congress leaders and killed over 1,000 Indians who participated in this movement. A number of violent
    attacks were also carried out by the nationalists against the British government.While 2.5 million Indians
    volunteered and joined on the British side and fought as a part of the Allied forces in Europe, North Africa and
    various fronts of the World War II, the Quit India Movement played a role in weakening the control over the South
    Asian region by the British regime and ultimately paved the way for Indian independence. <br><br>

    <b style="font-size:larger"> Truth and Satyagraha

    </b><br><br>
    <img src="/Assets/Principles_3.jpg" alt="Mahatma Gandhi" class="sub_images_right">
    Gandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or Satya, and called his movement satyagraha, which
    means "appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth".The first formulation of the satyagraha as a political
    movement and principle occurred in 1920, which he tabled as "Resolution on Non-cooperation" in September that year
    before a session of the Indian Congress. It was the satyagraha formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that
    deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming
    him quickly into Mahatma. <br><br>


    "God is truth. The way to truth lies through ahimsa (nonviolence)" - Sabarmati, 13 March 1927
    Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic ideal of self-realisation, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and
    universal love. William Borman states that the key to his satyagraha is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts.
    According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of
    Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism,
    but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but
    Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn
    Richards, are best understood in the context of the Hindu terminology of Dharma and á¹šta. <br><br>

    Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. Gandhi
    summarised his beliefs first when he said "God is Truth". He would later change this statement to "Truth is God".
    Thus, satya (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is "God". Gandhi, states Richards, described the term "God" not as a
    separate power, but as the Being (Brahman, Atman) of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, a nondual universal that
    pervades in all things, in each person and all life. According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of
    God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that atman exists and is same as
    everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this atman. <br><br>


    Gandhi picking salt during Salt Satyagraha to defy colonial law giving salt collection monopoly to the British.[288]
    His satyagraha attracted vast numbers of Indian men and women.
    The essence of Satyagraha is "soul force" as a political means, refusing to use brute force against the oppressor,
    seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed, aiming to transform or "purify" the
    oppressor. It is not inaction but determined passive resistance and non-co-operation where, states Arthur Herman,
    "love conquers hate". A euphemism sometimes used for Satyagraha is that it is a "silent force" or a "soul force" (a
    term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his "I Have a Dream" speech). It arms the individual with moral
    power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a "universal force", as it essentially "makes no
    distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe." <br><br>

    Gandhi wrote: "There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a
    true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause."[292]
    Civil disobedience and non-co-operation as practised under Satyagraha are based on the "law of suffering",[293] a
    doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or
    progress of an individual or society. Therefore, non-co-operation in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the
    co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.[ <br><br>
