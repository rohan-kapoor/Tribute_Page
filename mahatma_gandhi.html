            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869 - 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,anti-colonial
            nationalistand political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for
            India's independence from British rule.He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
            The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa,
            is now used throughout the world. Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in
            the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain
            years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to
            represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that
            Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915,
            aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to
            protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.

                    <div id="bio">Biography</div>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati
                    Hindu Modh Bania family in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar
                    Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the
                    British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822-1885), served as the dewan (chief
                    minister) of Porbandar state. His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was
                    then Junagadh State.Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in
                    the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.During his tenure, he married
                    four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third
                    marriage was childless.
