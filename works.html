    Tagore's experiences with drama began when he was sixteen, with his brother Jyotirindranath. He wrote his first
    original dramatic piece when he was twenty — Valmiki Pratibha which was shown at the Tagore's mansion. Tagore stated
    that his works sought to articulate "the play of feeling and not of action". In 1890 he wrote Visarjan (an
    adaptation of his novella Rajarshi), which has been regarded as his finest drama. In the original Bengali language,
    such works included intricate subplots and extended monologues. Later, Tagore's dramas used more philosophical and
    allegorical themes. The play Dak Ghar (The Post Office; 1912), describes the child Amal defying his stuffy and
    puerile confines by ultimately "fall[ing] asleep", hinting his physical death. A story with borderless
    appeal—gleaning rave reviews in Europe—Dak Ghar dealt with death as, in Tagore's words, "spiritual freedom" from
    "the world of hoarded wealth and certified creeds". Another is Tagore's Chandalika (Untouchable Girl), which was
    modelled on an ancient Buddhist legend describing how Ananda, the Gautama Buddha's disciple, asks a tribal girl for
    water. In Raktakarabi ("Red" or "Blood Oleanders") is an allegorical struggle against a kleptocrat king who rules
    over the residents of Yaksha puri.

    Chitrangada, Chandalika, and Shyama are other key plays that have dance-drama adaptations, which together are known
    as Rabindra Nritya Natya. <br><br>

    Tagore began his career in short stories in 1877—when he was only sixteen—with "Bhikharini" ("The Beggar Woman").
    With this, Tagore effectively invented the Bengali-language short story genre. The four years from 1891 to 1895 are
    known as Tagore's "Sadhana" period (named for one of Tagore's magazines). This period was among Tagore's most
    fecund, yielding more than half the stories contained in the three-volume Galpaguchchha, which itself is a
    collection of eighty-four stories. Such stories usually showcase Tagore's reflections upon his surroundings, on
    modern and fashionable ideas, and on interesting mind puzzles (which Tagore was fond of testing his intellect with).
    Tagore typically associated his earliest stories (such as those of the "Sadhana" period) with an exuberance of
    vitality and spontaneity; these characteristics were intimately connected with Tagore's life in the common villages
    of, among others, Patisar, Shajadpur, and Shilaida while managing the Tagore family's vast landholdings. There, he
    beheld the lives of India's poor and common people; Tagore thereby took to examining their lives with a penetrative
    depth and feeling that was singular in Indian literature up to that point. In particular, such stories as
    "Kabuliwala" ("The Fruitseller from Kabul", published in 1892), "Kshudita Pashan" ("The Hungry Stones") (August
    1895), and "Atithi" ("The Runaway", 1895) typified this analytic focus on the downtrodden. Many of the other
    Galpaguchchha stories were written in Tagore's Sabuj Patra period from 1914 to 1917, also named after one of the
    magazines that Tagore edited and heavily contributed to. <br><br>
    <b style="font-size:larger">Novels</b><br><br>
    <img src="/Assets/Novel.jpg" alt="Rabindranath_Tagore" class="sub_images_right">
    Tagore wrote eight novels and four novellas, among them Chaturanga, Shesher Kobita, Char Odhay, and Noukadubi. Ghare
    Baire (The Home and the World)—through the lens of the idealistic zamindar protagonist Nikhil—excoriates rising
    Indian nationalism, terrorism, and religious zeal in the Swadeshi movement; a frank expression of Tagore's
    conflicted sentiments, it emerged from a 1914 bout of depression. The novel ends in Hindu-Muslim violence and
    Nikhil's—likely mortal—wounding. <br><br>

    Gora raises controversial questions regarding the Indian identity. As with Ghare Baire, matters of self-identity
    (jāti), personal freedom, and religion are developed in the context of a family story and love triangle. In it an
    Irish boy orphaned in the Sepoy Mutiny is raised by Hindus as the titular gora—"whitey". Ignorant of his foreign
    origins, he chastises Hindu religious backsliders out of love for the indigenous Indians and solidarity with them
    against his hegemon-compatriots. He falls for a Brahmo girl, compelling his worried foster father to reveal his lost
    past and cease his nativist zeal. As a "true dialectic" advancing "arguments for and against strict traditionalism",
    it tackles the colonial conundrum by "portray[ing] the value of all positions within a particular frame [...] not
    only syncretism, not only liberal orthodoxy, but the extremist reactionary traditionalism he defends by an appeal to
    what humans share." Among these Tagore highlights "identity [...] conceived of as dharma." <br><br>

    In Jogajog (Relationships), the heroine Kumudini—bound by the ideals of Śiva-Sati, exemplified by Dākshāyani—is torn
    between her pity for the sinking fortunes of her progressive and compassionate elder brother and his foil: her roue
    of a husband. Tagore flaunts his feminist leanings; pathos depicts the plight and ultimate demise of women trapped
    by pregnancy, duty, and family honor; he simultaneously trucks with Bengal's putrescent landed gentry. The story
    revolves around the underlying rivalry between two families—the Chatterjees, aristocrats now on the decline
    (Biprodas) and the Ghosals (Madhusudan), representing new money and new arrogance. Kumudini, Biprodas' sister, is
    caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She had risen in an observant and sheltered traditional
    home, as had all her female relations. <br><br>

    Others were uplifting: Shesher Kobita—translated twice as Last Poem and Farewell Song—is his most lyrical novel,
    with poems and rhythmic passages written by a poet protagonist. It contains elements of satire and postmodernism and
    has stock characters who gleefully attack the reputation of an old, outmoded, oppressively renowned poet who,
    incidentally, goes by a familiar name: "Rabindranath Tagore". Though his novels remain among the least-appreciated
    of his works, they have been given renewed attention via film adaptations by Ray and others: Chokher Bali and Ghare
    Baire are exemplary. In the first, Tagore inscribes Bengali society via its heroine: a rebellious widow who would
    live for herself alone. He pillories the custom of perpetual mourning on the part of widows, who were not allowed to
    remarry, who were consigned to seclusion and loneliness. Tagore wrote of it: "I have always regretted the ending".
