    <b style="font-size:larger">1905 - Annus Mirabilis papers</b><br><br>
    The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum
    theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der
    Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics
    and changed views on space, time, and matter.
    <br><br>
    <b style="font-size:larger">Special relativity</b><br><br>
    Einstein's "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper" ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June
    1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations (the laws of
    electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.
    Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds
    close to the speed of light). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of
    relativity. <br><br>

    This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving
    body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion. This paper also
    argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was
    superfluous.[note 4] <br><br>

    In his paper on mass-energy equivalence, Einstein produced E = mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity
    equations. Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading
    physicists, starting with Max Planck.[note 5] <br><br>

    Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, Hermann
    Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski's
    formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity. <br><br>
    <b style="font-size:larger">Physical cosmology</b><br><br>
    In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. He
    discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding.
    As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the
    cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The
    modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's
    understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static
    universe. <br><br>

    Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model
    of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The Friedmann-Einstein universe of 1931 and the
    Einstein-de Sitter universe of 1932. In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming
    that it was "in any case theoretically unsatisfactory". <br><br>

    In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as
    his "biggest blunder", based on a letter George Gamow claimed to have received from him. The astrophysicist Mario
    Livio has recently cast doubt on this claim. <br><br>

    In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after
    learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the
    universe. In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the
    expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process
    he associated with the cosmological constant. As he stated in the paper, "In what follows, I would like to draw
    attention to a solution to equation that can account for Hubbel's [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant
    over time" ... "If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it.
    For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."
    <br><br>

    It thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle,
    Bondi and Gold. However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the
    idea. <br><br>

    <b style="font-size:larger">Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox</b><br><br>
    In 1935, Einstein returned to quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in a
    collaboration with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox. In a
    thought experiment, they considered two particles, which had interacted such that their properties were strongly
    correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would
    result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise, a precise momentum measurement
    of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to
    disturb the other particle in any way. <br><br>

    Given Einstein's concept of local realism, there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these
    properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the
    reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly
    called "spooky action at a distance"). <br><br>

    Einstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in
    question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the
    Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell's theorem, which J. S. Bell had delineated in 1964. The results of these
    and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of
    physics in which "particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable
    to communicate with the other after they have separated." <br><br>

    Although Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite,
    entangled quantum states, has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the most influential papers published in
    Physical Review. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.
