    <img src="/Assets/Albert_Einstein_at_the_age_of_three_(1882).jpg" alt="Albert Einstein" class="sub_images_right">
    Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a family
    of secular Ashkenazi Jews. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880,
    the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein
    & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current. <br><br>

    Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight,
    he was transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium [de]), where he received
    advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later. <br><br>

    In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they
    lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient
    alternating current (AC) standard.[23] The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the
    Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. In Pavia, the Einsteins settled in
    Palazzo Cornazzani, a medieval building where, at different times, Ugo Foscolo, Contardo Ferrini and Ada Negri
    lived. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold
    Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities
    and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative
    thought was lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in
    Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.During his time in Italy, he wrote a short essay
    with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field". <br><br>

    Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The
    12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer.Einstein also independently
    discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem aged 12.A family tutor Max Talmud says that only a
    short time after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, "[Einstein] had worked through the whole
    book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics ... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high
    I could not follow."His passion for geometry and algebra led the 12-year-old to become convinced that nature could
    be understood as a "mathematical structure".Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old
    he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus". <br><br>

    At the age of 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music),Einstein was introduced to
    Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: "At the time he was still a
    child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to
    him."<br><br>

        class="sub_images_left">
    Early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple
    had a daughter named "Lieserl", born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić
    returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein's letter
    in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.
    <br><br>

    Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern,
    Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić
    returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that, despite their close relationship before,Einstein's chief
    romantic attraction was now his cousin Elsa Löwenthal;she was his first cousin maternally and second cousin
    paternally.Einstein and Marić divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.As part of the divorce
    settlement, Einstein agreed to give Marić any future (in the event, 1921) Nobel Prize money. <br><br>

    In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong
    feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: "I think of you in
    heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be." He spoke about a "misguided love" and a
    "missed life" regarding his love for Marie. <br><br>

    Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. They emigrated to the
    United States in 1933. Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.

    In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam. In a
    volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006, Einstein described about six women, including
    Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel
    (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom he
    received gifts while being married to Elsa. Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa, Einstein was briefly in
    a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who was married to the Russian sculptor Sergei
    Konenkov (who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton).[failed

    After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two years searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss
    citizenship in February 1901, but was not conscripted for medical reasons. With the help of Marcel Grossmann's
    father, he secured a job in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office, as an assistant examiner - level III. <br><br>

    There, he evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical
    typewriter. In 1903, his position at the patent office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion
    until he "fully mastered machine technology". Much of his work was related to questions about transmission of
    electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up
    conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of
    light and the fundamental connection between space and time. <br><br>

    With a few friends he had met in Bern, he started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named "The
    Olympia Academy", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Sometimes they were joined by Marić who
    attentively listened but did not participate. Their readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and
    David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook. <br><br>
    In the spring of 1913, Einstein was enticed to move to Berlin with an offer that included membership in the Prussian
    Academy of Sciences, and a linked University of Berlin professorship, enabling him to concentrate exclusively on
    research.On 3 July 1913, he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Max Planck and Walther
    Nernst visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post
    of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be established.Membership in the academy
    included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at Humboldt University of Berlin. He was officially
    elected to the academy on 24 July, and he moved to Berlin the following year. His decision to move to Berlin was
    also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had started a romantic affair. Einstein
    assumed his position with the academy, and Berlin University, after moving into his Dahlem apartment on 1 April
    1914.As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was delayed. The
    institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director.In 1916, Einstein was elected president
    of the German Physical Society (1916-1918). <br><br>

    <img src="/Assets/Einstein_thesis.png" alt="Thesis" class="sub_images_left">
    In 1900, Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen" ("Conclusions from the Capillarity
    Phenomena") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik. On 30 April 1905 Einstein completed his dissertation, A
    New Determination of Molecular Dimensions with Alfred Kleiner, serving as pro-forma advisor. His thesis was accepted
    in July 1905, and Einstein was awarded a PhD on 15 January 1906. <br><br>

    Also in 1905, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (amazing year), he published four groundbreaking
    papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy,
    which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26. <br><br>

    By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The
    following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich,
    Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was
    appointed associate professor in 1909. <br><br>

    Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting
    Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works,
    five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. <br><br>

    In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was a professor of theoretical
    physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum
    mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and
    friend Marcel Grossmann. <br><br>

    When the "Manifesto of the Ninety-Three" was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent
    German intellectuals that justified Germany's militarism and position during the First World War—Einstein was one of
    the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic "Manifesto to the Europeans". <br><br>
