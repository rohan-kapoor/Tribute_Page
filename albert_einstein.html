            Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 - 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged
            to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Best known for developing the theory
            of relativity, he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.
            Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics.His mass-energy equivalence formula E
            = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".His work is
            also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for
            his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
            effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality
            resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius". Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the
            periodic table, was named in his honor.

                    1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg)[note 1] the
                    following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching
                    diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he
                    acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903, he secured a
                    permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the
                    University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences
                    and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, he became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
                    for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian.
