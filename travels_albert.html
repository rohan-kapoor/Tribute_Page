    Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor
    John Francis Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at
    Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington, he accompanied representatives of the National
    Academy of Sciences on a visit to the White House. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman
    and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual, and political
    figures, and delivered a lecture at King's College London. <br><br>

    He also published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.", in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe
    some characteristics of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville, who published his own impressions in Democracy
    in America (1835). For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: "What strikes a visitor is the
    joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy."
    <br><br>

    In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as
    he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first
    public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to
    his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true
    feel for art. In his own travel diaries from his 1922-23 visit to Asia, he expresses some views on the Chinese,
    Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered
    in 2018. <br><br>

    Because of Einstein's travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the
    Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was made by a German diplomat, who
    praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist. <br><br>

    On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days, his only visit to that region. He was greeted as if he were
    a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British
    high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see
    and hear him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be
    recognized as a force in the world. <br><br>

    Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal and also received a
    diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences. <br><br>


    Albert Einstein at a session of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (League of Nations) of which
    he was a member from 1922 to 1932
    From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of
    Nations in Geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923-1924),[108] a body created to promote international
    exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists, and intellectuals.[109] Originally slated to serve as
    the Swiss delegate, Secretary-General Eric Drummond was persuaded by Catholic activists Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe
    Motta to instead have him become the German delegate, thus allowing Gonzague de Reynold to take the Swiss spot, from
    which he promoted traditionalist Catholic values.[110] Einstein's former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the
    Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee.<br><br>

    In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as
    a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology. After the national attention he received during his
    first trip to the US, he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and
    invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all. <br><br>

    After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with
    the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by
    the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and
    met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as "the ruling monarch of the mind".[116] Harry
    Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a
    full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he
    joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration. <br><br>

    Einstein next traveled to California, where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan. His
    friendship with Millikan was "awkward", as Millikan "had a penchant for patriotic militarism", where Einstein was a
    pronounced pacifist.[117] During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to
    do more harm than good. <br><br>

    This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted
    for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him
    to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner.
    Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a "highly emotional temperament", from
    which came his "extraordinary intellectual energy". <br><br>

    Chaplin's film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to
    join him as his special guests. Walter Isaacson, Einstein's biographer, described this as "one of the most memorable
    scenes in the new era of celebrity".Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his
    "modest little flat" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was
    "possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis". <br><br>
